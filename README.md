DAY1
created a basic music player application using android studio with kotlin for my mobile phone which doesn't have a inbuilt musicplayer.
POSITIVES:
  *It is successfully displaying songs which are available in my mobile phone and plays it after touching the song.
  *The Quality seems to be OK
NEGATIVES:
  *UI should be improved
  *songs doesnt play in sequential manner
